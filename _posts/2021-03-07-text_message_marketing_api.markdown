Our text messaging API makes it easy to send personalized text messages to prospects. Just send us a few details about your prospect and they'll receive a personalized text message with a call to action. For example: 

Hi John, this is your insurance agent Reid Tattersall. Did you know you could protect your loved ones with life insurance for as low as $30 per month for $1,000,000? Here’s a link for an instant quote: https://boss.back9ins.com/t/35a77cf5-3109-40c8-88b2-6c94190bbb4e

When your prospect clicks on the link, it'll launch your Quote & Apply website with the client’s information pre-filled.
