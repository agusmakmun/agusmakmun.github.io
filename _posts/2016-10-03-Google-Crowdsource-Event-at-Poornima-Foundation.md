We all live in a country with people of diverse origins, who speak different languages. We speak of connecting each and every person to the latest feed and tech. through internet. But are they really able to take full benefits of internet?

The answer is big NO.
The most of the content available on internet is only in English(i.e 53.6% according to wikipedia), followed by Russian(6.4%) and then German(5.6%). The rest of language either play a small fraction in  it or has no part at all. Thus, due to lack of information available in native languages, people can't get benefitted from internet despite of it's huge and endless powers.

In this regard, **GOOGLE** has taken a huge step to connect people to internet by increasing the amount of content available in other languages.
<hr>
## How that would be possible?
It would be basically done by translating the available content into other languages.

## We already have google translate, what's new about crowdsource app?
Well there are many features available in crowdsource app like

 * It works OFFLINE. Yes, you heard right, crowd source caches the data once connected to internet and will sync again once you connect to internet
 * If you have spare 5-10 minutes you can contribute it as a part of development of content in the languages you know.
