### Introduction
If you are using Quote & Apply in a direct to consumer setting, converting users to leads is a top priority. We've introduced an email capture feature to improve your lead conversion.

### Your customer's experience
Before your customer can see rates, they will be presented with a modal asking for their email address. Customer's won't be able to continue without providing a valid email address. Once they provide an email address, you'll be emailed the new lead's contact information, the customer's information will appear with your BOSS account, and your customer can view the rates.

### How to enable email capture
To enable email capture, log into [BOSS](https://app.back9ins.com) > Quote & Apply > [Setup](https://app.back9ins.com/#/electronic_applications/setup) > edit a specific Quote & Apply > change the option for Email Capture. By default, email capture is off.
