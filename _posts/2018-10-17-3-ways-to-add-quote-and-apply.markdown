## 3 Ways to Add Quote & Apply
### Introduction
Below are the three most common [Quote & Apply](https://www.inslock.com) implementations.
### 1. Embed Quote & Apply into your Website
For customers with an existing website, embedding Quote & Apply allows you to run quotes and take applications on your existing website. Here's an [example website](https://americainsured.org) using the embedded method. To set this up, log into [BOSS](https://app.back9ins.com) > Quote & Apply > Setup > type in your domain > you'll receive a script which you can paste into the HTML of your website. Presto!

### 2. BackNine Links
For customers without a website, or if adding to your website is too difficult (technically or due to compliance), BackNine links are usually the suggested implementation. Over 80% of Quote & Apply applications are completed on a BackNine Link. When you create an account in BOSS, you'll automatically be emailed a BackNine link, here's an example BackNine Link: https://app.back9ins.com/apply/ReidTattersall. You can create as many BackNine Links as you like and also customize the name (e.g. https://app.back9ins.com/apply/AgencyName). To create a BackNine Link, log into BOSS > Quote & Apply > Setup > type in the name you'd like to use > your BackNine Link will be instantly available.

### 3. Custom Domain Links
Starting today :wave:, for customers with a website and with a significant amount of agents, Custom Domain Links allow your agents to use Quote & Apply on your domain (e.g. https://app.yourdomain.com/AgentName instead of https://app.back9ins.com/apply/AgentName) and don't require you to set up webpages for your agents. To set this up, log into your domain's DNS settings (e.g. GoDaddy), type in a subdomain (e.g. app) and point it to subdomain.yourdomain.herokudns.com (e.g. app.google.herokudns.com). Notify engineering@back9ins.com once you've saved your DNS changes and we'll make a change so that you can create links within BOSS > Quote & Apply > Setup with your custom domain. An example use case is a P&C agency with 200 agents, rather than embedding Quote & Apply into 200 pages, simply add the agents into BOSS and they will automatically be emailed a Quote & Apply website on your domain.
