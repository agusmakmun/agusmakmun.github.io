### Introduction
One simple change in BOSS is all that it takes to turn Quote & Apply into a sign up page for agents. Changing the Start Page from Apply to Select Agent results in Quote & Apply asking agents for their National Producer Number, email, and password. Once the agent creates their account, they will be emailed a Quote & Apply page, have a BOSS login, and will automatically be under your hierarchy.
