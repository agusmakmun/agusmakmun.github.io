### TLDR
View life insurance quotes and apply online from within RedTail beginning 4/19/2020.

### Steps to get started

#### Enable life insurance quoting in Redtail by going to your RedTail integrations page

#### Add your National Producer Number (NPN)
![Redtail Add NPN Screen](https://d1usw6tyldpxhi.cloudfront.net/retail-add-npn-screen.png "Redtail Add NPN Screen")

BackNine uses your NPN to obtain your contact information and insurance licenses. You'll only be able to quote in the states you are licensed. Your NPN is also how BackNine knows you're the agent for the quote/eApp.  

#### Launch Quote & Apply when viewing a contact in Redtail
