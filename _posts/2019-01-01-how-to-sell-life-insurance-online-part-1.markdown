### Introduction

I wanted to run an experiment to see if agents can profitably sell life insurance online using [Quote & Apply](https://inslock.com). We'll pay $2,000 for web traffic and will share the resulting clicks, leads, applications, and placed policies, as well as the revenue, costs, and profit.

### Lead Source
We'll be using [Consumers Advocate](https://www.consumersadvocate.org) as the lead source for this test. You can buy web traffic from a number of companies though. I personally like Consumers Advocate because the user's path to our website is clear. A prospect Google searches "best life insurance" and sees Consumers Advocate as a top paid search result. The user is directed to a guide showing recommended agencies/companies to buy life insurance from. Our websites will be on the list competing with the likes of AIG Direct, Health IQ, Haven Life, and Policy Genius.

### Websites
I set up two websites to test different products.
1. [ltc-rider.com](https://ltc-rider.com) is on Consumers Advocate's [Best Long Term Care Companies Guide](https://www.consumersadvocate.org/long-term-care-insurance/best-long-term-care-insurance) and focuses on John Hancock's Protection UL with Long Term Care. At $10 per click, we'll be the number one recommendation and will receive 100 clicks for $1,000. We limited the state to only California so our ad runs for a longer time. We expect an agent to get involved on these sales, a longer sales cycle, and a higher average premium.

2. [instantaccidentaldeath.com](https://instantaccidentaldeath.com) is on Consumers Advocate's [10 Best Life Insurance Companies page](https://www.consumersadvocate.org/life-insurance/best-life-insurance). Since life insurance is more competitive than long term care insurance, we'll be the number 8 ad on their recommended guide. Also at $10 per click, we'll receive 100 clicks for $1,000. Since the average case size is so low with Accidental Death, we won't be assigning an agent to leads and expect interested buyers to buy the coverage online (üëç for guaranteed issue and 100% placement ratio).

### Set up
- Purchased two domains: [ltc-rider.com](https://ltc-rider.com) and [instantaccidentaldeath.com](https://instantaccidentaldeath.com) from GoDaddy.com for $24.
- Switched the DNS from GoDaddy to [Cloudflare's](https://www.cloudflare.com/) free plan for speed improvements for $0.
- Used [Heroku](https://heroku.com) to host the website for $7/month.
- Implemented [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control for $0.
- Bought a theme called [Advent](http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0LB7F49) from [wrapbootstrap.com](http://wrapbootstrap.com) for $18 and changed the text and images.
- Used [Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com/) to generate logos for $9.99/logo.
- Added Quote & Apply to each website. I limited the product categories to Life with Long Term Care and Accidental Death respectively. Quote & Apply is free when using [BackNine Insurance](https://back9ins.com) as the general agency.
- Implemented [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) for reporting on each website.
- The total cost for both websites was $61.98 + $7/month.
