Nationwide's [IUL Accumulator II](https://www.nationwide.com/nationwide-indexed-ul-accumulator-II.jsp) is now on [Quote & Apply](https://intelligentquote.com)

### Highlights
- Illustrating IUL has never been easier with Quote & Apply. Nationwide is our second IUL carrier which means you can now compare IUL products.
- Nationwide is one of the few mutual life insurance carriers with an IUL. IUL has non-guaranteed aspects and in the midst of other carriers increasing cost of insurance on inforce policies, it's important to look at the company.
- Nationwide's IUL is enabled by default so you don’t need to made adjustments to your Quote & Apply for it to appear. Note that we only support their accumulation IUL so you'll only see it under Accumulation IUL within Quote & Apply.
- Sorry New York, it's not available.
