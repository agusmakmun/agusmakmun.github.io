BackNine's Instant APS reduces the turnaround time for the attending physician statement from weeks to seconds.

### How it works
When an APS is needed, instead of using a traditional medical records retrieval process, an email will go to the insured and agent with a link to a website where the insured can enter the username and password to their medical facility's patient portal. After the insured successfully authenticates, BackNine will have the insured's APS to forward onto the carrier.

### About the email to your client
- It's sent from bot@mail.intelligentquote.com, the agent is CC'd, and the Reply To is set to the agent's email address.
- Here's the message:

Hi INSURED NAME,

CARRIER NAME needs your medical records in order to make a decision on your life insurance application (POLICY NUMBER).

Please use this invitation to connect your medical facility's patient portal with CARRIER NAME. You can learn about the medical records retrieval process by [clicking here](https://news.back9ins.com/reid_tattersall/2019/08/14/about-instant-aps-for-insureds.html).

Please contact me at AGENT PHONE or AGENT EMAIL with questions.

Thank you,

AGENT EMAIL

### Costs
There are no added costs to the agent or insured to use BackNine's Instant APS.

### Let's do this❗️
Instant APS is our default process. We'll revert to using the traditional APS retrieval process at the agent's request or if the medical facility does not have a patient portal.
