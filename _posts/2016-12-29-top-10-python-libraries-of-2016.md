Today we will make a very simply blog application and host it freely on github.io. This post is intended for those who want to publish their programming achivements and experience. I personally want to document all my work that i do in my free time and the things i learn for in my programmer career. Here are the step of bulding a blog website using UBUNTU 14.4 and publish it on the github.io free of cost and tons of effort.
