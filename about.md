Always that I need to write about me I remember the Jackie Chan movie - [Who Am I](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127357/)  - and my mind and inspiration is lost for a moment, but let me stretch my knuckles:

So, honestly I view myself as a wanderer on Earth trying to understand the purpose of life and practice the good by trying to manage the people around me as best as I can while striving for the least toxic feeling as possible.

I consider myself also passionate in learning multiple topics  like the ones more tech driven like programming and architecture or even going through the inter-personal lane as in "Conflict management".

This blog will be a channeling support tool to help me extract many rants I have in my mind and also try to transpose some of my experience to others.

Imagine like a camp-fire where an old man is telling old stories, being sometimes strange or even interesting sometimes. This old-man does not mind if he is speaking to no one of to a bunch of people :)
