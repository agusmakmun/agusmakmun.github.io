I currently work at Boxed Wholesale. My interests lies in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. Most of my previous internship experiences in Data Science have better shaped the way I look at solving business problems with my technical knowledge. 

My current focus is on improving my software engineering skills. Occasionally, I read research papers on topics I'm interested in. And other times, I work out and enjoy a good time with my social circle.
